# ü§ìDocker-Py-ReVanced

A little python script that will help you in building Revanced and Revanced-Extended [apps](#note).

**`Note`** - If you are a root user and want magisk module (Extended). Get them [here](https://github.com/nikhilbadyal/revanced-magisk-module)

This is just a builder for revanced and not a revanced support. Please be understanding and refraining from asking
about revanced features/bugs. Discuss those on proper relevant forums(on Revanced GitHub , Discord)

**`Note`** - I prefer [Revanced Extended](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/tree/revanced-extended) more
(for YouTube & YouTube Music) hence the YouTube and YouTube Music builds in this repo are from
Revanced Extended.

## Pre-Built APKs

You can get pre-built apks [here](https://revanced_apkss.t.me/)

## Build Yourself

   Add the apps you want to build in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in
   `GitHub secrets` in the format
   ```ini
   PATCH_APPS=<REVANCED_APPS_NAME>
   ```

   If you are using `Revanced Extended.` Add `_EXTENDED` in exclude options.
   Example:
   ```dotenv
    EXCLUDE_PATCH_YOUTUBE_EXTENDED=custom-branding-red,custom-branding-blue,materialyou
    EXCLUDE_PATCH_YOUTUBE_MUSIC_EXTENDED=custom-branding-music
   ```
5. If you want to build a specific version . Add `version` in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended)
   in the format

   beta) .
   Add `latest` in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended) in the format

   TWITTER_VERSION=latest
   REDDIT_VERSION=latest
   TIKTOK_VERSION=latest
   WARNWETTER_VERSION=latest
   ```

7. If you don't want to use default keystore. You can provide your own by placing it
   inside `apks` folder. And adding the name of `keystore-file` in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets`
   (Recommended) in the format
   ```dotenv
    KEYSTORE_FILE_NAME=revanced.keystore
   ```
8. If you want to use Revanced-Extended for YouTube and YouTube Music. Add the following adding
   in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended) in the format

    BUILD_EXTENDED=True
   ```
   or disable it with (default)

9. For Telegram Upload.
    1. Set up a telegram channel, send a message to it and forward the message to
       this telegram [bot](https://t.me/username_to_id_bot)
    2. Copy `id` and save it to `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`<br>
       <img src="https://i.imgur.com/22UiaWs.png" width="300" style="left"><br>
    3. `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - Telegram provides BOT_TOKEN. It works as sender. Open [bot](https://t.me/BotFather) and
       create one copy api key<br>
       <img src="https://i.imgur.com/A6JCyK2.png" width="300" style="left"><br>
    4. `TELEGRAM_API_ID` - Telegram API_ID is provided by telegram [here](https://my.telegram.org/apps)<br>

    6. After Everything done successfully the actions secrets of the repository will look something like<br>
       <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dzC1KFa.png" width="400">
10. You can build only for a particular arch in order to get smaller apk files.This can be done with by adding comma
    separated `ARCHS_TO_BUILD` in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended) in the format.
    ```dotenv
     ARCHS_TO_BUILD=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a
    ```
    Possible values for `ARCHS_TO_BUILD` are: `armeabi-v7a`,`x86`,`x86_64`,`arm64-v8a`
    Make sure you are using `revanced-extended` as `revanced` doesn't support this.
11. You can scan your build apks files with VirusTotal. For that, Add `VT_API_KEY` in `GitHub secrets`.
12. Configuration defined in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` will override the configuration in `.env` file. You can use this
    fact to define your normal configurations in `.env` file and sometimes if you want to build something different just
    once. Add it in `GitHub secrets`.<br>
    Or you can ignore what I said above and always use `GitHub secrets`.
13. If APKMirror or other apk source is blocked in your region or script somehow is unable to download from apkmirror.
    You can download apk manually from any source. Place them in `/apks` directory and provide environment variable
    in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets`(Recommended) in the format.
    ```dotenv
     EXISTING_DOWNLOADED_APKS=<Comma,Seperate,App,Name>
    ```
    Example:
    ```dotenv
     EXISTING_DOWNLOADED_APKS=youtube,youtube_music
    ```
    If you add above. Script will not download the `Youtube` & `youtube music`apk from internet and expects an apk in
    `/apks` folder.

    Name of the downloaded apk must match with the available app choices found [here.](#note)
14. If you run script again & again. You might hit GitHub API limit. In that case you can provide your Personal
    GitHub Access Token in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended) in the format -
    ```dotenv
     PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<PAT>
    ```
15. Sample Envs<br>

16. Make your Action has write access. If not click [here](https://github.
    com/nikhilbadyal/docker-py-revanced/settings/actions). In the bottom give read and write access to Actions.
