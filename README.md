# ü§ìDocker-Py-ReVanced

A little python script that will help you in building Revanced [apps](#patch-apps).

**`Note`** - If you are a root user and want magisk module (Extended). Get them [here](https://github.com/nikhilbadyal/revanced-magisk-module)

This is just a builder for revanced and not a revanced support. Please be understanding and refrain from asking
about revanced features/bugs. Discuss those on proper relevant forums.

## Pre-Built APKs

You can get pre-built apks [here](https://revanced_apkss.t.me/)

## Build Yourself

You can use any of the following methods to build.

- üöÄ **_GitHub**_ (**_`Recommended`_**)

     1. Click Star to support the project.<br>

       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/nikhilbadyal/docker-py-revanced
       ```
    5. cd to the cloned repo
       ```bash
       cd docker-py-revanced
       ```
    6. Update `.env` file if you want some customization(See notes)
    7. Run script with
       ```shell
       docker-compose up --build
       ```

- üê≥With Docker

    1. Install Docker(Skip if already installed)

       docker run -v "$(pwd)"/apks:/app/apks/  nikhilbadyal/docker-py-revanced
       ```
       You can pass the below environment variables (See notes) with the `-e` flag or use the `--env-file`
       [flag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#options).

    <br>Please verify the source of original APKs yourself with links provided. I'm not responsible for any damage
    caused.If you know any better/safe source to download clean. Open a discussion.
2. By default, script build the latest version as recommended by `patches.json` team.
3. Remember to download the **_Microg_**. Otherwise, you may not be able to open YouTube/YouTube Music.
4. <a id="patch-apps"></a>By default, tool will build only `youtube`. To build other apps supported by patching
   resources.Add the apps you want to build in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` in the format
   ```ini
   PATCH_APPS=<APP_NAME>
   ```
   Example:
   ```ini
   PATCH_APPS=youtube,twitter,reddit
   ```
5. <a id="existing-downloaded-apks"></a>If APKMirror or other apk sources are blocked in your region or script
   somehow is unable to download from apkmirror. You can download apk manually from any source. Place them in
   `/apks` directory and provide environment variable in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets`(Recommended)
   in the format.
   ```dotenv
    EXISTING_DOWNLOADED_APKS=<Comma,Seperate,App,Name>
   ```
   Example:
   ```dotenv
    EXISTING_DOWNLOADED_APKS=youtube,youtube_music
   ```
   If you add above. Script will not download the `youtube` & `youtube_music`apk from internet and expects an apk in
   `/apks` folder with **same** name.
6. <a id="personal-access-token"></a>If you run script again & again. You might hit GitHub API limit. In that case
   you can provide your Personal GitHub Access Token in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended)
   in the format -
   ```dotenv
    PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<PAT>
   ```
7. <a id="global-resources"></a>You can provide Direct download to the resource to used for patching apps `.env` file
   or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended) in the format -
   ```dotenv
    GLOBAL_CLI_DL=https://github.com/revanced/revanced-cli
    GLOBAL_PATCHES_DL=https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches
    GLOBAL_PATCHES_JSON_DL=https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches
    GLOBAL_INTEGRATIONS_DL=https://github.com/revanced/revanced-integrations
   ```
   Resources downloaded from envs and will be used for patching for any **APP_NAME**.
   Unless provided different resource for the individual app.<br><br>
   Tool also support resource config at app level. You can patch A app with X resources while patching B with Y
   resources.
   This can be done by providing Direct download link for resources for app.<br>
   Example:
   ```dotenv
    YOUTUBE_CLI_DL=https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-cli
    YOUTUBE_PATCHES_DL=https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches
    YOUTUBE_PATCHES_JSON_DL=https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches
    YOUTUBE_INTEGRATIONS_DL=https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-integrations
   ```
   With the config tool will try to patch youtube with resources from inotia00 while other global resource will used
   for patching other apps.
   *Note* - The link provided must be DLs. Unless they are from GitHub.
8. <a id="global-keystore-file-name"></a>If you don't want to use default keystore. You can provide your own by
   placing it inside `apks` folder. And adding the name of `keystore-file` in `.env` file or in `ENVS` in `GitHub
   secrets` (Recommended) in the format
   ```dotenv
    GLOBAL_KEYSTORE_FILE_NAME=revanced.keystore
   ```
   Tool also support providing secret key at app level. You can sign A app with X key while signing B with Y
   key.<br>
    Example:
   ```dotenv
    YOUTUBE_KEYSTORE_FILE_NAME=youtube.keystore
   ```
9. <a id="global-archs-to-build"></a>You can build only for a particular arch in order to get smaller apk files.This
   can be done with by adding comma separated `ARCHS_TO_BUILD` in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended) in the
   format.
   ```dotenv
    GLOABAL_ARCHS_TO_BUILD=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a
   ```
   Tool also support configuring at app level.<br>

   Example:
   ```dotenv
    YOUTUBE_ARCHS_TO_BUILD=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a
   ```
   *Note* -
   1. Possible values are: `armeabi-v7a`,`x86`,`x86_64`,`arm64-v8a`
   2. Make sure the patching resource(CLI) support this feature.
10. <a id="custom-exclude-patching"></a>If you want to exclude any patch. Set comma separated patch in `.env` file
    or in `ENVS` in `GitHub secrets` (Recommended) in the format
    ```ini
    <APP_NAME>_EXCLUDE_PATCH=<PATCH_TO_EXCLUDE-1,PATCH_TO_EXCLUDE-2>
    ```
    Example:
    ```dotenv
     YOUTUBE_EXCLUDE_PATCH=custom-branding,hide-get-premium
     YOUTUBE_MUSIC_EXCLUDE_PATCH=yt-music-is-shit
    ```
    Note -
    1. **All** the patches for an app are **included** by default.<br>
    2. Revanced patches are provided as space separated, make sure you type those **-** separated here.
